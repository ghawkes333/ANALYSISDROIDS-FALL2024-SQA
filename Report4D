I wrote YML scripts that define tasks that the GitHub Actions runs. I learned how to write YML files and automatically run the scripts via GitHub Actions. I learned that GitHub Actions includes numerous templates for YML files that are easy to plug in. The GitHub Actions in the repo compiles, lints, and fuzzes the project files.
